I'm doing these programs both as an exercise and because I think they might be genuinely helpful.

1. inequality_solver.py
   This program lets you find the solution to non-fractional single variabile inequalities, already written in standard form (where the LHS 
   is composed of some 1° and 2° degree factors and the RHS is just 0).
   It's possible to insert factors of the form ax^2 + bx + c, and the program will output the solution.
   Notes: I think the code is a bit inefficient and difficult to understand, I'll try to see if it can be improved in some way.
